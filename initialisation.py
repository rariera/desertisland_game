Are you ready??
You slowly awaken to a dazzling bright light.
It's the sun.
Aduh!
Haven't you played these games before?
Point is youâ€™re stuck on a desert island.
The smell of salt is on the air.
Above you, seagulls circle in the sky like vultures,
looking for their next meal... Yeah, you should
probably get away from here
You see a shelf of rock to the east,
To the west, the beach stretches out of sight.
The jungle is to the north of you and the ocean the south.
The sun blazes on above you.
If you are unsure what to do, type 'help'.''')
